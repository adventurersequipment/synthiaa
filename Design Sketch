Overview
The agent will be a composite entity, combining visual perception models, large language models (LLMs), and decision-making algorithms to operate autonomously within an MMORPG. The agent will possess a sense of self, governed by a self-referential LLM.

Components
Visual Perception Layer

1.1 MobileNet for Object Detection: Identifies in-game items, NPCs, and environmental features.

1.2 Preprocessing Module: Standardizes input images for object detection.

Natural Language Understanding Layer

2.1 GPT-4 for Contextual Understanding: Understands game context, interprets visual data, and structures narrative.

2.2 Task-Specific LLMs: Specialized language models for handling specific tasks like combat strategy, inventory management, etc.

Decision-Making Layer

3.1 Reinforcement Learning Module: For game mechanics-based decision-making.

3.2 Executive Function Module: High-level decision-making based on GPT-4's narrative.

Self Model

4.1 Self-Referential LLM: Interprets in-game and internal states to construct a sense of self.

4.2 Memory Buffer: Stores historical states and actions for self-reflection and learning.

Interface Layer

5.1 Game API Interface: Directly interacts with the game's API if available.

5.2 Simulated User Input: Simulates mouse and keyboard inputs for games without an accessible API.

Active Learning Loop

6.1 Data Augmentation: Utilizes LLMs for real-time data augmentation.

6.2 Feedback Mechanism: Incorporates real-time feedback to adapt and optimize behavior.

Data Flow
Visual Perception -> NLU Layer: MobileNet feeds object detection results to GPT-4 for contextual understanding.

NLU Layer -> Decision-Making Layer: Contextual data is used to make in-game decisions through RL and Executive Function modules.

Decision-Making Layer -> Self Model: Decisions and outcomes update the self model for future reference and learning.

Self Model -> NLU Layer: The Self-Referential LLM provides context and history to GPT-4 for better narrative and decision-making.

Decision-Making Layer -> Interface Layer: Decisions are translated into in-game actions via the interface layer.

Interface Layer -> Active Learning Loop: Captured data and outcomes are used for real-time training and adjustment.

Operational Guidelines
Modularity: Each component should be modular to allow for individual testing, upgrades, and potential replacement.

Real-Time Operation: The system should be optimized for real-time interaction with the MMORPG.

Scalability: The architecture should be scalable to allow for additional modules or higher complexity as the project evolves.

Self-Awareness: The Self Model is crucial for the agent's long-term learning and adaptation. It should be updated in real-time and be capable of complex self-referential reasoning.
