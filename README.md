Creating an embodied agent for an MMORPG that integrates various elements like visual perception, decision-making, and self-awareness.

Constructing an autonomous agent for an MMORPG like Everquest that can interact naturally through the game's native interface

1. **Environment Sensing**: 
    - Develop a computer vision module to read the game's native interface. Utilize OpenCV for image recognition and object detection.

2. **User Input Simulation**:
    - Use libraries like PyAutoGUI to simulate keyboard and mouse actions. Must be capable of navigation and basic interactions within the game.
  
3. **Data Aggregation**:
    - Implement a data collector that combines visual data from the game and text data from in-game chats. This data will be crucial for training the language and decision models.

4. **Natural Language Understanding**:
    - Initially employ a pre-trained GPT-4 model for contextual understanding and narrative formation. Fine-tune based on aggregated data.
  
5. **Decision Making**:
    - Implement a simple Reinforcement Learning (RL) model for decision-making based on state-action pairs. Integrate this with the NLU model for higher-level reasoning.

6. **Memory Buffer and Self Model**:
    - Create a self-referential buffer that can store historical states and actions. This will feed into the self model for future decisions.

7. **Active Learning Loop**:
    - Implement a feedback mechanism that updates the models in real-time based on actions and outcomes in the game.

8. **Internet Scanning**:
    - Develop a web scraper to pull data from online forums, guides, etc., to inform the agent's knowledge and strategies.

9. **Initial Testing**:
    - Run the agent in isolated, controlled in-game situations to verify each component's functionality and inter-component communication.

10. **Iterative Development**:
    - Continuously update and optimize each module based on real-world performance and new research findings.

Given the architecture and these initial steps, the development process will be inherently iterative, continuously evolving based on both in-game and external data.
